Description: Cell-Lineage-from-Normalized-Covariance (CLiNC) is a method to reconstruct developmental hierarchies from clonal barcoding data.  Briefly, the model underlying CLiNC assumes that all barcodes are deposited as a synchronous moment in differentiation and that differentiation events are not directly coupled to cell division (as in asymmetric division).
